/**
 * Canonical list of structured question types — the single runtime source
 * the `StructuredQuestionType` union derives from. Lives in the types layer
 * so `src/types/*` never imports from the components tree (the legacy
 * arrangement derived this union from
 * `components/Questionnaire/data/StructuredFormData`, inverting the layer
 * dependency).
 *
 * Adding a type here is step one of the checklist in
 * `src/components/QuestionnaireV2/structured/` — the total registry there
 * refuses to compile until the new member has a definition.
