Care is a React Typescript Project, built with Vite and styled with TailwindCSS.

Care uses a custom useQuery hook to fetch data from the API. APIs are defined in the api.tsx file

Here's an example of how to use the useQuery hook to fetch data from the API:

```
useQuery from "@core/Common/hooks/useQuery";
const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(routes.getFacilityUsers, {
  facility_id: "1",
});

request from "@core/Common/utils/request";
const { res } = await request(routes.partialUpdateAsset, {
  pathParams: { external_id: assetId },
  body: data,
});
```
