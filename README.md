## Getting started

- üí¨ Comment on the issue if you are willing to take it up, and link the pull request with the issue.
- üè∑Ô∏è Tag `@coronasafe/code-reviewers` for faster resolution.
- üì∏ Attach screenshots in the pull requests showing the changes made in the UI.

#### Install the required dependencies

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

#### üèÉ Run the app in development mode

```sh
npm run dev
```

Once the development server has started, open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. The page will be automatically reloaded when you make edits and save. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### üîë Staging API Credentials

Authenticate to staging API with any of the following credentials

```yaml
- username: dev-districtadmin
  password: Coronasafe@123
  role: District Admin

- username: staffdev
  password: Coronasafe@123
  role: Nurse

- username: doctordev
  password: Coronasafe@123
  role: Doctor
```

#### Contributing to CARE

- Create a branch with branch name of the format `issues/{issue#}/{short-name}` (example `issues/7001/edit-prescriptions`) from the latest [`develop`](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/tree/develop) branch when starting to work on an issue.
- Once the changes are pushed to the branch, make a pull request with a meaningful title (example: "üíä Adds support for editing prescriptions" #6369)
- Ensure the issue number is mentioned in the PR with a closing tag by following the PR body template. (Refer: [Linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword))
- Once the code review is done, the PR will be marked with a "Needs Testing" label where it'll be queued for QA testing.
- Once tested, the PR would be marked with a "Tested" label and would be queued for merge.

#### üß™ Run cypress tests

Ensure that the development server is running and then run the cypress tests in either of the ways described below.

```sh
$ npm run cypress:run        # To run all tests in headless mode.
$ npm run cypress:run:gui    # To run all tests in headed mode.
$ npm run cypress:open       # To debug and run tests individually.
```

- Failed test screenshots are saved in `cypress/screenshots`
- All test videos are saved in `cypress/videos`

## üöÄ Production

#### Build the app for production

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### Start a production `http-server`

```sh
npm run preview
```

Starts a production http-server in local to run the project with Service worker.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

**üöÄ Your app is ready to be deployed!**
